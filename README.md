Alternating_Block_Method - Hydrology - IDF Curves

The alternating block method is a method to make the rainfall temporal distribution (design hyetograph) using the rainfall intensity-duration-frequency (I-D-F) curve. IDF Curves in Greece are determined using a formula whose parameters change based on the nearest rainfall station. Thie parameters file is attached in folder named "Data".

The hyetograph was exported as an excel file since it is a more user friendly format for those who are not familiar with programming. Openpyxl is a Python library to read/write Excel 2010 xlsx/xlsm/xltx/xltm files.

It is worth mentioning that a hyetograph was created in the second excel sheet as well.
